# work with windows environment path variables


Goal
**********************
1. work with windows environment path variables
2. list system and user environment variables
2. Allow me to update user and system environment path variable
2. Provide checks that I am not making a mistake inadvertently
2. Use numbered prompts to execute commands
3. Use defensive coding :)


Initiali checks
************************
1. None

Input paramenters
**********************
1. None

Run behavior
****************************
1. Provide the following functions
2. List all these functions in a numbered list for user to pick the function number to execute
2. help - to display help how this program works and what it can do and show the each function as a menu item
3. show system paths - show system paths on multiple lines one per path, order them based on their parent directories
4. show user paths - show user paths on multiple lines one per path, order them based on their parent directories
5. update system path - see instructions on how to code it and what the inputs are
6. update user path - see instructions on how to code it and what the inputs are
7. update the current path - see instructions on how to code it and what the inputs are
7. show total paths for the current environment - on multiple lines for readability
7. exit - exit the script
7. after executing each function show the menu again until exit function is chosen


Instructions for update user path
************************************
1. Prompt the user for a path
2. Prompt the current directory as a default for that selection
3. if the directory is already in the path (system or user) indicate that and exit the function (not the program)
3. Prompt the user that you are going to append the specified user path 
5. if the answer is Y or yes change the user path
6. On success Indicate that the user path has changed
7. Call the show user paths function to list the user paths

Instructions for update system path
************************************
Follow the same rules as the user path function but apply that to the system path instead

Instructions for update current path
************************************
Do the same as the user path, but just change the current env path in the current session

How to write the code
**************************
1. Make it really modular by abstracting these activities into various functions
2. Encapsulate all in a main method that is executed in the end
3. Use a menu pattern
4. If possible use the braces {} on separate lines
