# Spec to prompt useful git commands and execute them as a set of functions

Goal
**********************
1. Create a set of useful git utilities each as a function
2. Prompt the user functions available
3. Prompted function names should have a brief description after their name
4. Allow me to extend it for other github scripts in the future if that is easy to do.

How to write the code
**************************
1. Make it really modular by abstracting these activities into various functions
2. Especially the final function that executes all of the git commands
3. Encapsulate all in a main method that is executed in the end
4. Allow to add more functions in the future
5. use object oriented way to define functions with an execute method that calls if necessary get inputs, validations, and final execution

Initial functions
****************************
1. One that displays git status in a git repo dir
2. show all remotes 
3. show remote origin details via git remote origin
