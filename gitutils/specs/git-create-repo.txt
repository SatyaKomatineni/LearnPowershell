# Spec to create a git create repo

Goal
**********************
1. Create a new repo based on the current directory 
2. Provide checks that I am not making a mistake inadvetently
3. Use defensive coding :)
4. Allow me to extend it for other github scripts in the future if that is easy to do.

Initiali checks
************************
1. Make sure the cuurent directory ends in a name ..repo, if it is not point that out and exit
2. That it is not a repo already, if it is point that out and exit
3. Prompt that you are going to create a repo based on the current directory


Input paramenters
**********************
1. Use the current directoy 
2. Take the first commit message as input

Run behavior
****************************
accept 2 options -help, -Run, -mimic, -list

-help explain what it does and what the input args are
-mimic list the  input options with which you are going to execute
-Run list the  input options with which you are going to execute and ask for a permission to move forward and if yes execute, if no return
-list after indicating the input parameters used, just list the git commands that you are going to execute but return after the listing

How to write the code
**************************
1. Make it really modular by abstracting these activities into various functions
2. Especially the final function that executes all of the git commands
3. And each option -help, -run, -mimic, -run encapsulated into their respective functions
