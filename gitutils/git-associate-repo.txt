# Spec to associate a directory to a matching empty repo

Goal
**********************
1. Associate a directory to a matching empty repo
2. Provide checks that I am not making a mistake inadvetently
3. Use defensive coding :)
4. Allow me to extend it for other github scripts in the future if that is easy to do.

Initiali checks
************************
1. Make sure the cuurent directory ends in a name ..repo, if it is not point that out and exit
2. That it is not a repo already, if it is point that out by naming its remote repo and exit
3. Prompt that you are going to associate this repo with the remote repo
4. Check that a remote repo exists with this name derived from the current directory


Input paramenters
**********************
1. Use the current directoy as the directory to associate to the remote repo

Run behavior
****************************
accept 2 options -help, -Run, -mimic, -list

-help explain what it does and what the input args are
-mimic list the  input options with which you are going to execute
-Run list the  input options with which you are going to execute and ask for a permission to move forward and if yes execute, if no return
-list after indicating the input parameters used, just list the git commands that you are going to execute but return after the listing

Git related expectations
******************************
1. Names of the local repo and remote repo matches
2. there is no .git in the local repo
3. Just do a git init and associate the current directory with an empty repo on server

How to write the code
**************************
1. Make it really modular by abstracting these activities into various functions
2. Especially the final function that executes all of the git commands
3. And each option -help, -run, -mimic, -run encapsulated into their respective functions
4. Encapsulate all in a main method that is executed in the end
