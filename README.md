6. [Powershell basics: install, videos, startup journal on this topic](http://www.satyakomatineni.com/akc/display?url=DisplayNoteIMPURL&reportId=5561&ownerUserId=satya). I usually start my learning any new topic with a knowledge mining document at this site. This is that starting document. This is the path I followed in learning this topic. This is a mixture of various searches, findings, summaries, references, links, and the rest of the documents would have spawned from here.
